# Direnv

Flake entrypoint should be direnv via .envrc file.
File .envrc should watch flake and its modules and files they depend
on for changes to reload.

When you change flake.nix, flake.lock, or any watched file, direnv
must reload before new packages or shell hooks take effect. Run
`direnv reload` after such changes and verify the shell reflects them.

If direnv prints `direnv: error .envrc is blocked`, run `direnv allow`
to unblock it.

When a command fails with "command not found" for a tool that should
be in the dev shell, the likely cause is a stale direnv environment.
Run `direnv reload` before investigating further.
