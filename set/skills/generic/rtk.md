# RTK (Rust Token Killer)

RTK is a token-optimized CLI proxy that reduces context window usage
by 60-90% on common dev operations. CLAUDE.md has the full command
reference.

## Per-repo filters

`.rtk/filters.toml` exists in repos for per-project filter
customization, but RTK's built-in filters cannot be overridden via
this file today. Use `rtk proxy <cmd>` when a built-in filter hides
output you need.

## When to use rtk proxy

- `git push` (pre-push hooks produce critical output)
- Any command where you need the full, unfiltered output for debugging
- When RTK's filtering hides an error you need to diagnose

## When NOT to use rtk

- The Bash tool description says to prefer dedicated tools (Read, Grep,
  Glob, Edit) over shell commands. RTK wraps shell commands, so the
  same rule applies: use dedicated tools first, RTK-wrapped shell
  commands only when the dedicated tool cannot do the job.
