# Test: remote integration

Integration tests targeting remote hosts must fast-fail on
connectivity before running checks.

Pattern (`scripts/lib/ssh-wait.sh`):

1. Ping with exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 5s timeouts.
  Fail immediately after third ping failure.
2. SSH with same exponential backoff: 1s, 2s, 5s timeouts.
  Fail after third SSH failure.
3. On first SSH success, proceed to health checks.

Total wait is at most 16s before declaring host unreachable.
Avoids the default 60s SSH wait that blocks the operator when
the builder is powered off or unreachable.
