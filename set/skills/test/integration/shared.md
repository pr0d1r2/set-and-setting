# Test: shared health checks

Integration tests share health checks via a common Tcl library.

`tests/integration/lib/health-checks.tcl` defines all SSH-based
health checks in one place. Both `smoke.exp` and `live.exp` call
`run_health_checks` with a label, expected hostname, and optional
skip_tags list.

skip_tags control environment-specific sections:

- `hardware` -- KVM device, microcode, real storage tiers
- `network` -- interface UP, default route
- `mdns` -- avahi publish/resolve
- `qemu` -- 9p host store mount (only present in QEMU guests)

Smoke tests skip hardware/network/mdns (QEMU SLIRP differs).
Live tests skip boot/qemu (bare metal, no 9p).

When adding a new health check, add it to health-checks.tcl --
not to individual .exp files. The .exp files are thin wrappers
for boot/connection setup.
